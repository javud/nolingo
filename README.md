## About<!-- Required -->
<!-- 
* information about the project 
* 
* keep it short and sweet

- This application was built so that it could be used to learn a language, specifically spanish. The problem we wanted to solve was how to give people who may be starting out learning spanish a platform so that they could practice at their leisure. To do this we created an app that gives the user control and support during their learning experience, from giving sample sentences to picture hints.
